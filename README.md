## Instructions

Through the whole of the program you'll be working on your own data mining projects:
* You will setup your own data science environment
* Find and choose datasets for your projects
* Run several full data mining cycles
* Document and share your learnings
* Demonstrate you newly acquired competences and skills

Authors open de `.qmd` files in RStudio and follow the instructions. Make sure all steps in the data mining process are properly documented. The quality of documentation must be such that an informed data specialist must be able to understand the challenge and the conclusions, the design decisions and the reasons for the choices made during the process.

- Stretch and Challenge: Advanced students can further research and explore new algorithms for data mining, comparing their performance with KNN and Naive Bayes. 
- Inclusion: Students who are struggling can work with a partner or teacher during activities to ensure they comprehend the material.
