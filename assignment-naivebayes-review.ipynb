        "Landmines, remnants of past conflicts, continue to pose a significant threat in various regions worldwide. Their presence not only endangers military personnel but also disrupts civilian life and impedes development. Addressing this challenge, we turned to data science for a solution. Using a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks), we analyzed sonar signals. Specifically:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The dataset contains 111 patterns from sonar signals reflected off metal cylinders (representing mines).\n",
        "-   It also includes 97 patterns from signals reflected off cylindrical rocks.\n",
        "-   Each pattern is composed of 60 numbers, each indicating the energy within a specific frequency band.\n",
        "\n",
        "By employing the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm, we trained a model to classify these signals. The objective was clear: to accurately differentiate between signals from mines and those from rocks, providing a reliable tool for landmine detection and, ultimately, removal.\n",
